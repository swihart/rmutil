# `rmutil` R package

This package is intended to be the developmental version to the CRAN version of [Jim Lindsey's rmutil](http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html).  The .zip files listed on his homepage have been listed as version 1.0 (three component equivalent: 1.0.0) since 2005.  For the subsequent maintenance on this github and CRAN, we will start at 1.1.0. 

To compare this version with the static v1.0 files on [Jim Lindsey's Homepage](http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html), it may be useful to use [the compare page for this repo's two branches](https://github.com/swihart/rmutil/compare/master...jim-lindsey-homepage-version-1.0?diff=split&name=jim-lindsey-homepage-version-1.0).  Unfortunately, the green/red is not useful as I added the `jim-lindsey-homepage-version-1.0` well after I had made the initial commit of edits that is now the master branch.
