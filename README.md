# `rmutil` R package

This package is intended to be the developmental version to the CRAN version of [Jim Lindsey's rmutil](http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html).  The .zip files listed on his homepage have been listed as version 1.0 since 2005.  For the subsequent maintenance on this github and CRAN, we will start at 1.1.
