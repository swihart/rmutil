\title{Read a List of Matrices from a File for Repeated Times to Events}
\alias{read.surv}
\usage{
read.surv(file="", skip=0, nlines=1, cumulative=T, all=T)
}
\description{
\code{read.surv} reads sets of lines of data from a file. Each set may
contain a series of duration times followed by a censor indicator for
the last value (\code{all=FALSE}) or a series of pairs of times followed by
their censor indicators (\code{all=TRUE}).
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Name of the file to read}
\item{skip}{Number of lines to skip at the beginning of the file}
\item{nlines}{Number of lines in each series of duration times}
\item{cumulative}{If TRUE, the times are cumulative and differences
are taken to obtain times between events. Otherwise, the times are
used unchanged.}
\item{all}{If TRUE, all times have accompanying censor indicators;
otherwise, only the last one does.}
}
\value{
A list containing a list of vectors with the series of times and a
vector of censor indicators for the last time of each series is returned.
