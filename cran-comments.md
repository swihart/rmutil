This Package was archived on CRAN.  I am resurrecting it.
I have Jim Lindsey's permission to be maintainer of his packages on CRAN.  Currently he has them in .zip files on his homepage:  http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html.  He does not have access to the original email address he used when this package was on CRAN, and thus cannot send a separate confirmation email.  However, you can contact him at James Lindsey <jlindsey@gen.unimaas.nl>.
