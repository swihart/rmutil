## Resubmission 1
This is a resubmission.  In this version I have single quoted software names
in DESCRIPTION file and include a link to Lindsey's homepage to get the listed packages. 
The plan is to get all the listed packages on CRAN, but for now they are on his webpage.

## Test environments
* local OS X install: R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31)
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci): R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21)
* win-builder:        R Under development (unstable) (2016-11-22 r71678)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* 1st submission (Package was archived on CRAN, see Miscellaneous)

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

## Miscellaneous
As per the CRAN Repository Policy Version Revision 3577,

  *  Explain any change in the maintainerâ€™s email address and if possible send confirmation from the previous address (by a separate email to CRAN@R-project.org) or explain why it is not possible. 

This Package was archived on CRAN.  I am resurrecting it.
I have Jim Lindsey's permission to be maintainer of his packages on CRAN.  Currently he has them in .zip files on his homepage:  http://www.commanster.eu/rcode.html.  He does not have access to the original email address he used when this package was on CRAN, and thus cannot send a separate confirmation email.  However, you can contact him at James Lindsey <jlindsey@gen.unimaas.nl>.
